# MathML Cloud

Traditionally, accessing math with a screen reader has been a challenging prospect. This has changed in recent years due to advances in interpreting MathML content.

However, most publishers still display math content in images, as there is much inconsistency in how different browsers render MathML. The irony here is that accessible semantic math gets turned into an inaccessible image.

MathML Cloud builds upon MathJax, and the Speech Rules Engine, to provide a service that will take in an equation in either MathML, TeX, or Ascii Math, and return an image with alt text, as well as the MathML annotated with the alt text.
